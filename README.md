## 📁 Featured Projects

## 🔹 1. NYC Open Data Analysis — Crime, Housing Violations & Transportation
**Goal:** Analyze 50,000+ NYC records to explore the relationship between crime density, housing violations, and transportation access.

### **Key Contributions**
- Cleaned and merged multiple datasets (crime, violations, MTA transportation).
- Found a strong positive correlation *(r ≈ 0.78)* between housing violations and crime density.
- Built geospatial heatmaps and risk visualizations using **Folium**.
- Joined datasets using **SQL** for deeper urban insights.

### **Tools:** Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Folium), SQL, Jupyter Notebook

## 🔹 2. Intro to Data Science – Parkinson’s Telemonitoring EDA
Analyzes a biomedical dataset of **5,875 voice samples** from 42 Parkinson’s patients to explore how vocal features relate to disease severity.

### **Key Contributions**
- Loaded, validated, and prepared the dataset (22 voice-based features).
- Performed EDA: summaries, correlations, heatmaps, pairplots.
- Identified top correlated features affecting `total_UPDRS`.
- Investigated outliers using the IQR method.
- Highlighted voice metrics (NHR, RPDE) linked to disease progression.
  
### **Tools:** Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook
